## Description
### Project Aim ###
Keeping track of your interesting and collectable things can be a challenge. What search term did I use? What was the price some months ago? Is the price the real selling price or the seller wanted sale price? In comes app name, where you can search for your item and see the highest, lowest and average real sale price over a period of time.
